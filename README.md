# PCAP Ninja

A lightweight Python tool to analyze PCAP files and generate network traffic reports. It detects traffic patterns, security concerns, and provides insights based on the captured data.

## Features

- **Traffic Summary**: Analyze protocols, IPs, ports, packet sizes, and TCP flags.
- **Time Distribution**: View packet distribution by hour.
- **Top Conversations**: Identify top communication pairs.
- **Protocol Breakdown**: Statistics for HTTP, DNS, SSL, TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
- **Security Insights**: Detect potential DDoS attacks, port scanning, DNS tunneling, and deprecated SSL/TLS versions.
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions based on detected security concerns.

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/securezeron/PcapNinja.git
cd PcapNinja
```

2. Install dependeciies:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the script
```console
python3 pcapninja.py --pcap_file example.pcap
```

## Future Scope
- Enhanced protocol support for newer protocols such as QUIC.
- Real-time analysis with live network capture and dynamic report generation.
- Machine learning integration to detect anomalous traffic patterns and potential threats.
- Web interface with real-time graphs and visual insights for easier data interpretation.
- Customizable reporting options allowing users to define specific metrics or data points of interest.
- API integration for interoperability with other monitoring and security tools.
